# Perry-AI-Assistant
Description: This Python-based personal assistant is designed to enhance productivity by providing hands-free control over common tasks through voice commands. Using SpeechRecognition to process spoken language and pyttsx3 to convert text into speech, the assistant is capable of executing various functions such as launching popular websites, fetching information from Wikipedia, and playing music.

Key features include:

Voice Command Recognition: The assistant listens and processes user commands with real-time speech recognition, supporting natural language input for seamless interaction.

Text-to-Speech Responses: With the integration of pyttsx3, the assistant speaks back to the user, providing helpful responses and status updates on the tasks it performs.

Website Automation: Users can launch frequently visited websites like YouTube, Google, StackOverflow, and more, simply by saying commands like "Open YouTube" or "Open Google," which are executed through the webbrowser module.

Wikipedia Integration: The assistant can search Wikipedia for information and summarize results, allowing quick access to knowledge with a simple voice command, such as "Tell me about Python programming."

Time and Date Functionality: Users can ask for the current time or date, and the assistant will provide this information promptly.

Custom Voice Interactions: The assistant is customizable to respond with personalized greetings, such as acknowledging the user by name or even incorporating humorous or specific references in its responses, enhancing the personal touch.

Music Playback: The assistant can play music files directly from the system by simply asking it to play your favorite tracks. This functionality can be extended to integrate with music streaming services in future updates.

Expandable Framework: Built with modularity in mind, the project can be expanded to include additional features such as email automation, calendar scheduling, or IoT device control, making it a versatile starting point for more advanced personal assistant applications.
